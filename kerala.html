    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>kerala</strong>, southwestern coastal state of India. 
        It is a small state, constituting only about 1 percent of the total area of the country. 
        Kerala stretches for about 360 miles (580 km) along the Malabar Coast,
         varying in width from roughly 20 to 75 miles (30 to 120 km).
          It is bordered by the states of <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka">Karnataka</a> (formerly Mysore)
           to the north and <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> to the east and by the Arabian Sea to the south and west;
            it also surrounds <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mah%C3%A9,_India"> Mahe</a>, a segment of the state of Puducherry, on the northwestern coast. 
            The capital is <a style="text-decoration: none;" ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvananthapuram">Thiruvananthapuram</a> (Trivandrum).</p><br>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Although isolated from the Indian interior by the mountainous belt of 
                the Western Ghats, Kerala has been exposed to many foreign influences via its long coastline;
                 consequently, the state has developed a unique culture within the subcontinent, not only with 
                 a diverse religious tradition but also with its own language,<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam">Malayalam</a> . Also notable is the high 
                 social status that continues to be accorded to women of Kerala, owing to the former strength of a 
                 matrilineal kinship system. Area 15,005 square miles (38,863 square km). Pop. (2011) 33,387,677.</p><br>
    <h2> <b>History of Kerala;</b></h2>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Kerala is first mentioned (as Keralaputra) in a 3rd-century-BCE rock inscription left by the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Mauryan-Empire" style="text-decoration: none;">Mauryan emperor</a> <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ashoka" style="text-decoration: none;">Ashoka</a>.
         In the last centuries BCE this region became famous among the Greeks and Romans for its spices (especially pepper). 
         During the first five centuries CE the region was a part of Tamilakam—the territory of the Tamils—and thus was sometimes 
         partially controlled by the eastern Pandya and Chola dynasties, as well as by the Cheras. In the 1st century Jewish
          immigrants arrived, and, according to local Christian tradition, St. Thomas the Apostle visited Kerala in the same century
           (see St. Thomas [Mar Thoma] Christians).</p>
     <p style="text-align: justify;">Much of Kerala’s history from the 6th to the 8th century is obscure, but it is known that Arab traders introduced Islam later in the period.
         Under the Kulashekhara dynasty (c. 800–1102), Malayalam emerged as a distinct language, and Hinduism became prominent.</p> 
         <p style="text-align: justify;">The Cholas often controlled Kerala during the 11th and 12th centuries. By the beginning of the 14th century, Ravi Varma 
            Kulashekhara of the Venad kingdom established a short-lived supremacy over southern India. After his death, 
            Kerala became a conglomeration of warring chieftaincies, among which the most important were Calicut (now Kozhikode) 
            in the north and Venad in the south.</p> 
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The era of foreign intervention began in 1498, when Vasco da Gama landed near Calicut. In the 16th century 
                the Portuguese superseded the Arab traders and dominated the commerce of the Malabar Coast. Their attempt to
                 establish sovereignty was thwarted by the zamorin (hereditary ruler) of Calicut. The Dutch ousted the Portuguese 
                 in the 17th century. Marthanda Varma ascended the Venad throne in 1729 and crushed Dutch expansionist designs at 
                 the Battle of Kolachel 12 years later. Marthanda Varma then adopted a European mode of martial discipline and expanded
                  the Venad domain to encompass what became the southern state of Travancore. His alliance in 1757 with the raja of the 
                  central state of Cochin (Kochi), against the zamorin, enabled Cochin to survive. By 1806, however, Cochin and Travancore,
                 as well as the Malabar Coast in the north, had become subject states under the British Madras Presidency</p>
